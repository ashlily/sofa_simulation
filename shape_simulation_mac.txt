1.run shape control:
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="shape_control"
rosrun shape_control shape_control_node

2.run sofa:
cd sofa/build/bin/
./runSofa '/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/liver_control.py'

3.run client:
python '/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/test_client_save.py'

4.record data:

###record mesh error during shape control
0. make sure that fp and mp index are the same
1. record desired shape information
a. run shape control:
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="shape_control"
rosrun shape_control shape_control_node

b.run sofa:
cd sofa/build/bin/
./runSofa '/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/liver_control_record_desired_mesh.py'

c.run client:
python '/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/test_client_save.py'

>>>>>after that, the desired shape data is record in:
"/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/desired_shapes.txt"
>>>>and the desired feature is record in:
"/home/ashily/ros_ws/src/shape_control/data/current_features.txt"

d. update the desired feature:
"/home/ashily/ros_ws/src/shape_control/src/desired_feature.txt"


2. shape contro while recording mesh error
a. run shape control:
cd ~/ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="shape_control"
rosrun shape_control shape_control_node

b.run sofa:
cd sofa/v17.06/build/bin/
./runSofa '/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/liver_control_mesh_error.py'

c.run client:
python '/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/test_client_save.py'

>>>>>after that, the mesh error data is record in: (need to be delete the old txt first"
"/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/data_record/mesh_error.txt"
"/home/ashily/sofa_codes/shape_simulation/deformation_simulation/data_record/error_sum.txt"

run 3 py files:
1. liver_control_record_disired_mesh.py:
to record and save desired node positions

2. liver_control_read_index.py:
read fp index, for controller to compute desired features

3. liver_control_read_index_record.py:
for control cmd, and record mesh errors

note that: the deformation of 1 and 2 must be same

[IMPORTANT] when record data, first close sofa, then stop controller
